# Planties

Welcome to my fourth website!

This website was built as a **development milestone project** for the completion of the **Full-Stack Frameworks With Django** module and it's part of the learning material for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/about-us/) Fullstack Web Developer program.

A live **desktop demo** can be found [here](https://planties.herokuapp.com/).

The **source code** for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/gaspar91/planties).

# UX

## Strategy

This website was built to be an e-commerce plant shop for users to purchase, feel inspired and share their love for plants.

The website offers users the opportunity to purchase different kinds of plants and flowers, including a section with flowers for special occasions.

It also includes a blog with posts with different kinds of topics about plants.


## Scope

To comprehend what highlights should be incorporated, I perused the web for other comparable sites. 
I had a reasonable thought regarding what should be incorporated from my side yet I needed to view at it from a customer's viewpoint too.
For this, I did a brisk research as a costumer to comprehend what I would find interesting and catch my attention.
In light of this, I recognized these key points:

  1. An outwardly engaging **Home Page** which gives a quick look at what the store is selling.
    
  2. An **About** page to give some comprehension about what the store's objective.

  3. A **Product** page to exhibit all the products available.

  4. A **Special Occasions** page to help customers get inspired and find what they need for that special day.

  5. A **Profile** page for clients to enter their personal information and check their past orders.

  6. A **Blog** where customers can view and comment about diverse topics concerning plants.

  7. A **Shopping Bag** where customers can leave their desired products and then proceed to the checkout.


## Structute

There are 8 main pages, including the Home page, a Checkout page and a Login/Register page.
Other than these, there is a main page which fills in as the base for the wide range of various pages.

- **Home Page**

The home page gives gives a quick look at what the store is selling and a direct way to the Products page.

- **About Page**

This page discusses what is the store's concept and idea.

- **Products Page**

This page exhibits all of the store's products which can be arranged by *price*, *rate* and *category*.
Clients can click in every product which will lead them into the product detail page where there's a description of the product and the possibility of adding it to the shopping bag.

- **Plants Page**

This page exhibits all of the store's plants which can be arranged as *live plants* and *artificial plants*.
Clients can click in every product which will lead them into the product detail page where there's a description of the product and the possibility of adding it to the shopping bag.

- **Accessories Page**

This page exhibits all of the store's accessories which can be arranged as *pots* and *decorations*.
Clients can click in every product which will lead them into the product detail page where there's a description of the product and the possibility of adding it to the shopping bag.

- **Special Occasions Page**

This page exhibits all of the store's products for special occasions which arranged by *Valentines Day*, *Wedding Bouquets* and *Christmas*.
Clients can click in every product which will lead them into the product detail page where there's a description of the product and the possibility of adding it to the shopping bag.

- **Posts page**

This page as the name implies comprises of a series of posts added by the admin.
Clients can sort posts by Name A-Z and vice versa. Users can view posts but can only leave a comment if they are signed in.

- **Shopping Bag**

This page shows the user what they have added to the bag and can update and remove products.
There's also the possibility of browsing more products or continuing to the checkout page.

# Design Process

You'll be able to view the sketches, wireframes, and mockups for this project in the **assets** folder in the [Github project repository](https://github.com/gaspar91/planties).

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to build the wireframes, so you might need the program in order to view some of the documents.


# User Stories

### User Story One:

As someone who doesn't like to waste time with giving too much detail, filling up a short and quick register or login form is really nice and motivates me to do it.

### User Story Two:

As a user I want to be able to access, search and share recipes.

### User Story Three:

It's important to me to have my own profile page so I can see my own recipes.

### User Story Four:

It's important to know which recipes are mine and which are not, by having an edit button when I see all the recipes in the main page.

### User Story Five:

As a user I would like to add, edit, update or delete my own recipes.

### User Story Six:

It's important that the recipes have photos to help users to have an idea of what the dish looks like.

### User Story Seven:

As a user it is important that I have the necessary information to cook a recipe, such as what ingredients I might need, how long does it take to make it and the steps I need to take.

### User Story Eight:

It's important to me to see what other users have cooked through social media, with images and other people's comments.

### User Story Nine:

Accessibility is fundamental for me, so if I can search for recipes when I'm walking or I'm far away from my computer I can just search for it on my phone or tablet.

### User Story Ten:

It is also important that there is a confirmation of what I'm doing, like when I've registered, logged in, added, edited or deleted a recipe.

### User Story Eleven:

It's important to me to be notified if the recipe I looked for doesn't exist.

### User Story Twelve:

As a user I would like to know more about what cooking tools are necessary to have in the kitchen.
