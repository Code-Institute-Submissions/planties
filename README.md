# UX

## Strategy

This website was built to be an e-commerce plant shop for users to purchase, feel inspired and share their love for plants.

The website offers users the opportunity to purchase different kinds of plants and flowers, including a section with flowers for special occasions.

It also includes a blog with posts with different kinds of topics about plants.


## Scope

To comprehend what highlights should be incorporated, I perused the web for other comparable sites. 
I had a reasonable thought regarding what should be incorporated from my side yet I needed to view at it from a customer's viewpoint too.
For this, I did a brisk research as a costumer to comprehend what I would find interesting and catch my attention.
In light of this, I recognized these key points:

  1. An outwardly engaging **Home Page** which gives a quick look at what the store is selling.
    
  2. An **About** page to give some comprehension about what the store's objective.

  3. A **Product** page to exhibit all the products available.

  4. A **Special Occasions** page to help customers get inspired and find what they need for that special day.

  5. A **Profile** page for clients to enter their personal information and check their past orders.

  6. A **Blog** where customers can view and comment about diverse topics concerning plants.

  7. A **Shopping Bag** where customers can leave their desired products and then proceed to the checkout.

Other than these, there is a main page which fills in as the base for the wide range of various pages.

When the email is affirmed, they can log in to the site.

In the event that they have made any past purchases, that information is automatically filled in this page.

## Skeleton

You'll be able to view the sketches, wireframes, and mockups for this project in the **assets** folder in the [Github project repository](https://github.com/gaspar91/planties).
